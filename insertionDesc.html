<h3>
    Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works similar to the way you sort playing cards in your hands. The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part. Values from the unsorted part are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted part.

       pseudocode  <br>
       <br>
       function insertionSort(arr, n) <br>
{ <br>
    &nbsp&nbsp let i, key, j; <br>
    &nbsp   &nbsp for (i = 1; i < n; i++)<br>
    { <br>
        &nbsp   &nbsp&nbsp   &nbsp key = arr[i];<br> 
        &nbsp   &nbsp   &nbsp   &nbsp j = i - 1; <br>
        <br>
       
        &nbsp   &nbsp   &nbsp   &nbsp while (j >= 0 && arr[j] > key)<br>
        &nbsp   &nbsp   &nbsp   &nbsp { <br>
            &nbsp   &nbsp   &nbsp   &nbsp   &nbsp   &nbsp arr[j + 1] = arr[j]; <br>
            &nbsp   &nbsp   &nbsp   &nbsp   &nbsp   &nbsp j = j - 1; <br>
            &nbsp   &nbsp   &nbsp   &nbsp } <br>
